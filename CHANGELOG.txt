Version 0.3.1
-------------

    - Changed license from LGPL to more permissive Apache license
    - Merged changes from https://github.com/konstantint/PyIntervalTree to
      https://github.com/chaimleib/PyIntervalTree
      (formerly /MusashiAharon/PyIntervalTree)
    - Support for Python 2.6
    - Removed dependency on six
    - Fixed crash when querying empty tree
    - Intervals are ordered by begin, then end, then by data. If data is not
      orderable, sorts by type(data)
    - Easier display for debugging, using custom test/pprint.py
    - More sensitive exception handling
    - Fixed missing close parenthesis in examples

Version 0.3
-------------

    - Support for Python 3.2
    - Interval now inherits from a namedtuple. Benefits: should be faster. 
      Drawbacks: slight behavioural change (intervals not mutable anymore).

Version 0.2.3
-------------

    - Slight changes for inclusion in PyPI.
    - Some documentation changes
    - Added tests
    - Fixed the bug, where interval addition via [] would not work properly in Python 2.7
      (see http://bugs.python.org/issue21785)
    - Added intervaltree.bio subpackage, adding some utilities for use in bioinformatics
